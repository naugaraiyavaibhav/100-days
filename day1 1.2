Q2: Write a program to input two numbers and display their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

/*
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
10 2
Output 1:
Sum=12, Diff=8, Product=20, Quotient=5

Input 2:
7 3
Output 2:
Sum=10, Diff=4, Product=21, Quotient=2

*/


#include <stdio.h>

int main (){
    int a;
    int b;
   int sum,product,diff,quotient;
    a=10;
    b=2;
    sum=a+b, product=a*b, quotient=a/b, diff=a-b;
    printf("sum=%d\n product=%d\n diff=%d\n quotient=%d",sum,product,quotient,diff);

    return 0;
}
